# Zero-Shot_QA_FLASK

In this project, I created a simple Python using the HuggingFace's Transformers library which us an application that is answering "What is the capital of a country?".

1. Select a country.
2. Submit
3. Get the capital of the country.

NOTE: The choices of the country are limited to "Canada, Philippines and Tokyo"
